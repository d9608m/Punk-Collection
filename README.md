# Punk Collection 
Collect the Punks while avoiding the Wassies!

The aim of the game is to collect as many Punks (pixel heads) as possible to get the highest score. If a player hits a Wassie (green) it's game over. The purple rectangle is the playerâ€™s safe space. Punks that spawn farthest away from the safe space are worth 5 points while Punks that spawn nearest are only worth 1 point. The game speed will increase as you as your score increases.

Controls:
Arrow Keys - Movement (Up, Down, Right, Left)
