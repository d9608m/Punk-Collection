# Punk Collection 
Move around collecting Punks & avoiding the Wassies!
The box at the bottom is the playerâ€™s safe space. If a player hits a Wassie (Green) its game over. The aim of the game is to collect as many punks (Pixel Heads) as possible to get the highest score. Punks that spawn farthest away from the safe space are worth 5 points while Punks that spawn nearest are only worth 1 point. Your score is the number in the top right. The game speed will increase as you as your score increases. Best of luck!
